# Quick Summary:
This project explored how differences in national power — measured through military, economic, and demographic indicators — influence the likelihood of countries forming intergovernmental organizations (IGOs). Using data from the Correlates of War project, we analyzed over 900,000 records with Python and statistical modeling techniques to test whether greater disparities in capability increase cooperation. Through regression and correlation analyses, we found that states with diverse power levels are more likely to collaborate, suggesting that asymmetry can drive stability within alliances. Visualizations built with Matplotlib and Seaborn helped communicate these findings clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.
